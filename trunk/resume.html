            My Resume
          </h2>
          <div class="content-body">
            I graduated from a 4-year BS program at Georgia Tech in 2003 a full year early with a 4.0/4.0 major GPA.  I spent the two years after that working 40 hours a week as a Java Developer while obtaining my Master's on the side which I completed in 2005.
            <br/><br/>
            In the 4+ years since then, when I last updated my resume, I've worked at Google as a Software
            Engineer II, Software Engineer III, Senior Software Engineer, and Engineering
            Manager.  My work is currently focused on iGoogle and Google Homepage-related efforts.  See
            my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseshieh">Linkedin profile</a> for more information.
