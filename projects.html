                Janice and I worked on this project together in 2009.  I'd been organizing secret santa gift exchanges for my friends for a few years and had a script laying around to do the randomizing and email sending. Then one day I thought why not build a full webapp for it so that other people can use it too?

                Ken and I started a real estate investment company in 2008 and started making sophisticated spreadsheets to evaluate potential properties for purchase.  It turns out that a lot of the existing spreadsheets on the market weren't comprehensive enough so we sought to build one that included every metric an investor might look at including taxes and the time value of money to name a few.  We decided to put it online and see if anybody wanted to buy it.
